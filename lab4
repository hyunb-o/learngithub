# Basic Concepts of GUI, CLI, Kernel, and Shell

This document provides an overview of basic concepts related to GUI, CLI, Kernel, and Shell, as well as some common shell commands.

## 1. GUI (Graphical User Interface) and CLI (Command-Line Interface)

- **GUI** is an intuitive and visual interface, allowing users to interact with the system through graphical elements like icons, buttons, and windows.
- **CLI** uses text-based commands, offering more control and efficiency for advanced users. While it may have a steeper learning curve, it provides powerful and flexible system control.

## 2. Kernel

- The **kernel** is the core component of an operating system that connects hardware and software. It efficiently manages system resources and processes.
- The kernel's main responsibilities include managing CPU, memory, and device communication.

## 3. Shell

- The **shell** is an interface between the user and the operating system's kernel. It interprets commands entered by the user and forwards them to the kernel for execution.
- The shell is a command interpreter, which provides a way for users to interact with the kernel through text commands.

## 4. Common Shell Commands

Here are some commonly used shell commands:

- `pwd`: Displays the current working directory.
- `cd [directory]`: Changes the current directory to the specified directory. To move to the parent directory, use `cd ..`.
- `ls`: Lists the files and directories in the current directory.
- `clear`: Clears the terminal screen.
- `cp [Original] [Destination]`: Copies a file or directory to the destination.
- `mv [Original] [Destination]`: Moves or renames a file or directory.
- `rm [File]`: Deletes the specified file. To delete a directory and its contents, use `rm -r [directory]`.
- `mkdir [directory]`: Creates a new directory.

## Example

```bash
# Navigate to the home directory
cd ~

# List files in the current directory
ls

# Create a new directory named 'my_project'
mkdir my_project

# Copy a file from the current directory to 'my_project'
cp example.txt my_project/

# Move into the 'my_project' directory
cd my_project

# Rename the file inside 'my_project'
mv example.txt example_renamed.txt

# Clear the terminal screen
clear
