## Version Control and collaboration
- essential to use a version control system for software development and other documentation works.
 
## Changes and Snapshots
- changes : : Only stores differences between versions.
- snapshots :  Stores a full copy of the project at each point.

## Version control
- Local : Changes are tracked on a local machine.
- Centralized : A central server stores the history
- Distributed : Every contributor has a whole copy of the project.

## Git command
Various commands used to perform version management, such as tracking, committing, or creating and merging branches of code
- **'$ git int'**
This command is used to initialize a Git repository. When you run this command in a project folder, a hidden .git directory is created in the folder, allowing Git to track changes to the files in that project
- **'$ git status'**
 It tells you which files have been modified, which files are staged for commit, and which files are not being tracked yet.
- **'$ git add[file_name]'**
It prepares the file for commit. You need to replace [file_name] with the name of the file you want to stage.
- **'$ git add . '**
The . refers to the current directory, and it stages all modified or new files at once.
- **'$ git rm --cached [file_name]'**
It is useful for untracking a file while keeping it locally. Replace [file_name] with the name of the file.
- **'$ nano .gitignore'**
 The .gitignore file is used to specify files or directories that you want Git to ignore and not track.
- **'$ 'git commit -m â€œcommit message"'**
The -m flag allows you to directly write a commit message in quotes, which describes the changes.
- **'$ git branch -m master main'**
It is often used to rename the default branch to "main," following modern practices to adopt more inclusive terminology.
